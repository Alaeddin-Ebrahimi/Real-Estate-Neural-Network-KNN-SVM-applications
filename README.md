Real Estate Image Classifier using Keras & TensorFlow (MNIST Sample Base)
This project provides a sample Keras/TensorFlow pipeline for image classification, initially implemented using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. Although MNIST is used here as a prototype, the code serves as a foundation for real estate applications—such as classifying property images by type, quality, or architectural style—after substituting the dataset.
